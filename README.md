# Interactive Dashboard

An interactive dashboard built with React that visualizes data using dynamic charts, Material-UI for polished design, and simulated live data fetching. This project serves as a portfolio piece to demonstrate front-end development skills including interactivity, responsive design, and chart integrations.

## Overview

The Interactive Dashboard is a sample front-end application that displays dynamic chart data using [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) via the [react-chartjs-2](https://github.com/reactchartjs/react-chartjs-2) wrapper. It leverages [Material-UI](https://mui.com/) for an attractive, responsive layout and includes controls to switch between datasets and fetch simulated live data.

## Features

- **Dynamic Chart Visualization:**  
  Displays a sample line chart that can be updated interactively.
  
- **Interactivity with Controls:**  
  Uses Material-UI components such as Select and Button to allow users to switch between datasets and simulate live data updates.
  
- **Responsive Design:**  
  Built with Material-UI's Grid system and Container component making it mobile-friendly.
  
- **Live Data Simulation:**  
  Simulates fetching updated data using random number generation, with a structure in place to later integrate actual data fetching using Axios.

## Tech Stack

- **React:** Front-end framework (created with Create React App)
- **Chart.js & react-chartjs-2:** For data visualization
- **Material-UI:** For UI components and styling
- **Axios:** (Planned) For API data fetching
- **Git:** Version control, with the repository hosted on GitHub
